## Introduction

Driver drowsiness is a safety-critical problem, as it causes unsafe driving conditions by lowering reaction times, reducing attention, and impairing decision-making. 

* **The Impact:** An estimated **17.6% of fatal crashes** in the United States from 2017 to 2021 involved a drowsy or tired driver, resulting in approximately **30,000 deaths** during that period. 
* **Our Solution:** We are building a proactive system designed to reduce fatigue-related accidents. 
* **How it Works:** The system captures visual data of the driver and makes real-time inferences based on their body language. This keeps the driver in check, ensuring they are neither tired nor drowsy during their trip, which ultimately reduces mistakes.
* **Safety Precaution:** Fleet operators are integrated into the system as an extra layer of precaution. If a driver is drowsy and fails to stop and rest, the fleet operator will intervene and remind the driver to pull over, preventing accidents and keeping the roads safe.
